I am building a smart contracts project to help people crowdfund for projects. This project eliminates the mutability of transaction records that is characteristic of a centralized crowdfunding management system. This project provides a mechanism for the verification of crowdfunded projects, it also provides a mechanism for accountability and increase efficiency, and transparent transactional records to the donors (Sponsors) of the project. An Independent group of volunteer moderators verify milestone delivery and validates the withdrawals completed by the project creator. The project creators are incentivized to keep submitting proof so that they are able to do more withdrawals.
The moderators are also rewarded with tokens for the work they do.
