This is a smart contracts project to help people crowdfund for projects. 
This project eliminates the mutability of transaction records that is characteristic 
of a centralized crowdfunding management system.
This project provides a mechanism for the verification of crowdfunded projects, 
it also provides a mechanism for accountability. 
An Independent group of volunteer moderators verify milestone delivery and validates 
the withdrawals completed by the project creator. The project creators are incentivized 
to keep submitting proof so that they can do more withdrawals.
